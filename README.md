**Comment:**
Both Idea A and D are good 
On D: are you  trying to add value to what quora does with topics?
or something else.... it has to have novelty. 

On A: creating VMs and deploying  software using alexa would be tricky as it has to handle un  happy path (error handling)

pick the one that your team is most  confident of executing and remove other  ideas from the README

**Idea A: PaaS DevOps with Alexa**

Developing custom skill for Alexa to manage DevOps in cloud. Once could be able to bring deploy an image into EC2, add / remove instances from server cluster, change instance type configuration, query on instances performance metrics, billing queries etc.

Tech Stack: Alexa custom skill, AWS Lamda, PaaS provider
